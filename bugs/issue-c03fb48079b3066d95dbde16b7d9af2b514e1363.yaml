title: Authentication Not Remembered
desc: |-
  Many of the resources exposed by Wink have a public representation and an
  authenticated representation. The authenticated representation is used when the
  browser sends a valid Authorization header. However, in order to trigger the
  username/password prompt, an "Authorization Required" response must be sent.
  
  There's a resource: "/identify", that prompts for user information and redirects
  to another page (based on the "dest" parameter). Browsers do send authorization
  headers to the page redirected to but subsequent pages are not authenticated.
  
  The result is that you have to visit the "/identify" resource before each
  resource that requires authorization -- a real PITA.
  
  (I've only tested this with Firefox 2.x/3.x but I assume all browsers function
  similarly.)
  
  I'm not sure there's any really great fix for this issue. I was hoping to experiment
  with sending WWW-Authenticate headers with the public/unauthenticated 200 responses
  to see if that would coax the browser into providing auth information on subsequent
  requests.
