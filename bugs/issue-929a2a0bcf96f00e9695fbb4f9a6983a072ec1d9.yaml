title: Use wink.[option] for accessing author (and other options) instead of ivars
desc: |-
  We're currently setting @author and @begin_date in a before block. It would be
  much easier to manage these types of variables if we exposed them via helper
  methods instead.

    Let's create a single wink helper that just returns the Wink module for now.
    This will let us plumb in a different source of options in the future if we
    need to.
