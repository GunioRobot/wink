title: Separate customizable events / urls and templates from core -- allow for hacking
desc: |-
  We should keep all models, core helpers, and core Sinatra even handlers
  under lib/wink but split out any helpers and event handlers that might be
  customizable into a file at the root of the directory structure. The idea
  is to make things that people would want to customize easy to get at without
  throwing everything at them.
