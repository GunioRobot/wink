title: RDiscount's smartypants implementation screws with markup
desc: |-
  When you run the markdown filter (with RDiscount installed) over something
  like ...
  
      <a href=' http://www.google.com '>google.com</a>
  
  ... the result is ...
  
      <p><a href=' http://www.google.com &lsquo;>google.com</a></p>
  
  This is caused by RDiscount's SmartyPants implementation not detecting that
  the href attribute's end quote isn't normal text.
  
  This probably needs fixed upstream at RDiscount or Discount.
