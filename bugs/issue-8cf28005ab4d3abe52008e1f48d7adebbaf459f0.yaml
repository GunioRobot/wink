title: "Three phase boot: config, models, web"
desc: |-
  The current startup process goes roughly as follows:
  
    1. Initialize objects required for configuration.
    2. Load external config file.
    3. Require DataMapper models
    4. Require Sinatra/web event definitions
  
  Make it possible to enter any stage of this process by separating
  each step into separate files. For instance, requiring 'wink/config'
  should make it possible to configure the database and other things only.
  After configuration, you should be able to require only 'wink/models' if
  you just want to interact with the database. Requiring 'wink/web' would
  load the actual Sinatra event handlers.
