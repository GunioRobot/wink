Wink
====

Wink is a minimalists weblog engine written in Ruby using Rack, Sinatra, and
DataMapper. See the project repository on GitHub for more information:

http://github.com/rtomayko/wink/

Status
------

A complete mess, at the moment. It will likely not run for you at all. The
sources have been made available as-is for discussion purposes only. If you're
mainly interested in running a blog, watch for a 1.0 release. If you're
interested in hacking, stick around...

Requirements
------------

Gems (need all their dependencies of course):

    $ sudo gem install datamapper --version=0.2.5
    $ sudo gem install do_mysql
    $ sudo gem install sinatra BlueCloth rubypants html5

We are currently developing on MySQL only. Other databases are theoretically
easy to support but we're limiting to one for now to speed initial development.

Wink is currently being developed on MacOS X and FreeBSD.

Hacking
-------

Project sources are stored in Git:

    $ git clone git://github.com/rtomayko/wink.git

Create a new MySQL database:

    $ mysql -u root
    mysql> CREATE DATABASE wink_development CHARACTER SET = utf8 ;

Next, change into your local wink clone and copy the `development.conf.example`
to `development.conf`; edit to taste, making sure the database related settings
are adjusted appropriately.

Run the `db:init` task to create the initial table schema and then start a new
development server:

    $ rake db:init
    $ ruby wink

The application should be available at: http://localhost:4567
