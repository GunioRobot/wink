Wink
====

Wink is a minimalists weblog engine written in Ruby using Rack, Sinatra, and
DataMapper.

### Status

A complete mess, at the moment. It will likely not run for you at all. The
sources have been made available as-is for discussion purposes only. If you're
mainly interested in running a blog, watch for an 0.1 release. If you're
interested in hacking, stick around...

### Getting Started

First, create a new MySQL database:

    $ mysql -u root
    mysql> CREATE DATABASE wink_development CHARACTER SET = utf8 ;

Next, copy the `development.conf.example` to `development.conf` and edit to
taste.  Make sure the database related settings are adjusted appropriately.

Run the `db:init` task to create the initial table schema and start a new
development server:

    $ rake db:init
    $ ruby weblog.rb

The application should be available at: http://localhost:4567
