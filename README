Status
------

A complete mess, at the moment. It will likely not run for you at all. The
sources have been made available as-is for discussion purposes only. If you're
mainly interested in running a blog, watch for an 0.1 release. If you're
interested in hacking, stick around...

Hacking
-------

Project sources are stored in Git:

    $ git clone git://github.com/rtomayko/wink.git

Create a new MySQL database:

    $ mysql -u root
    mysql> CREATE DATABASE wink_development CHARACTER SET = utf8 ;

Next, change into your local wink clone and copy the `development.conf.example`
to `development.conf`; edit to taste, making sure the database related settings
are adjusted appropriately.

Run the `db:init` task to create the initial table schema and start a new
development server:

    $ rake db:init
    $ ruby weblog.rb

The application should be available at: http://localhost:4567
